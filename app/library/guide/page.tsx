              Books on loan may be reserved by another reader on application to

              reserved at the Issue Desk when it is returned and the reader is
              subsequently notified to collect the book within two days. If the
              book is not claimed before the end of this period, it is returned
              to the shelves. Readers who are leaving the College for a few days
              are advised (if they have reserved books) to inform any Assistant
              at the Issue Desk so that the reservation notice may not be sent
              to them while they are away. A book in constant demand cannot be
              reserved for long. Readers receive the book in the strict order of
              the date reserved.
